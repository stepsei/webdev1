      <p>The former Manchester United striker rejoined the Toffees on a two-year deal for an undisclosed fee last summer.
        The 32-year-old says he had options to move abroad on a big-money contract. "That's not me, I need those goals, I need that pressure. That desire to play would have been lost if I'd chosen that other option," he told Football Focus.

        But he chose to return to Goodison Park 13 years after leaving the Merseyside club.

        "Two years ago, I thought my best position to play was midfield, and that's starting to happen now.</p>
