          Speculation continues to surround Paul Pogba’s situation at Manchester United, with reports on Thursday suggesting that some of Europe’s top clubs are keeping tabs on the France international.
          Manchester United's £89million midfielder has struggled to maximise his potential in recent months and reports today claim this has placed strain on his relationship with Jose Mourinho.
          Elsewhere, Arsenal are said to be ready to rival the Manchester clubs – and Barcelona – for Ajax starlet Matthijs de Ligt.
          Stay tuned to Standard Sport for these stories and more with all the latest news and updates.

          Roberto signed that contract on Thursday and the Catalan-born player insisted that, despite reported interest from the likes of Manchester City and Manchester United, his heart was always set on staying with Barca.
          He said in quotes reported by the Spanish press: "Since renewal talks began I always wanted to be here. It's the club of my life and I've been a fan since I was small.
          "It's true that other clubs were interested, but I wanted to be here and I'm happy to have renewed until 2022. If I can continue even longer, then so much the better.

          He also hopes that regular appearances for Barca will help him realise an ambition of going to the World Cup with Julen Lopetegui's Spain squad.
          "To play in the World Cup with Spain would be a dream. I've already played in an Under-17s World Cup and another at under-20. Any player would want to go to a World Cup," said Roberto, who has won two of his three Spain caps under Lopetegui.
          "I'm close because I've been called up to several squads and I hope Julen Lopetegui gives me the opportunity to be at the World Cup. At the very least, I am going to work hard for it."
